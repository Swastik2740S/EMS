Employee Management System API
Overview
This project is an Employee Management System API built using Spring Boot. It provides CRUD operations for managing employees, roles, departments, attendance, salary, and user authentication/authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The system is designed to streamline employee management processes and ensure secure access control based on user roles.

Get All Employees
Endpoint: GET /api/employees
Returns a list of all employees.

Get Employee by ID
Endpoint: GET /api/employees/{id}
Returns details of a specific employee.

Delete Employee
Endpoint: DELETE /api/employees/{id}

Assign Roles
Endpoint: PUT /api/employees/{employeeId}/roles
JSON payload includes a list of role IDs to assign to an employee.

Remaining Functionalities
4. Department Management
Functionality to manage departments and assign employees to departments.

CRUD operations for departments:

Create Department (POST /api/departments)

Update Department (PUT /api/departments/{id})

Get All Departments (GET /api/departments)

Get Department by ID (GET /api/departments/{id})

Delete Department (DELETE /api/departments/{id})

Assign employees to departments.

5. Attendance & Leave Management (Optional)
This functionality is optional but useful for tracking employee attendance and leave requests.

Mark attendance for employees:

Create Attendance (POST /api/attendance)

Get Attendance Records (GET /api/attendance)

Delete Attendance Record (DELETE /api/attendance/{id})

Manage leave requests:

Create Leave Request (POST /api/leaves)

Approve/Reject Leave Request (PUT /api/leaves/{id})

6. Salary Management (Optional)
This functionality is optional but useful for managing employee salaries and payment statuses.

CRUD operations for salary records:

Create Salary Record (POST /api/salaries)

Update Salary Record (PUT /api/salaries/{id})

Get All Salary Records (GET /api/salaries)

Get Salary Record by Employee ID (GET /api/salaries/{employeeId})

Delete Salary Record (DELETE /api/salaries/{id})

7. User Management
Functionality required for managing system users (e.g., Admin, HR, etc.).

CRUD operations for users:

Create User (POST /api/users)

Update User (PUT /api/users/{id})

Get All Users (GET /api/users)

Get User by ID (GET /api/users/{id})

Assign roles to users (similar to assigning roles to employees).

8. Authentication & Authorization
This functionality secures the system by restricting access based on user roles (e.g., Admin, HR, Employee).

Implement login functionality using Spring Security and JWT:

Login API (POST /login)
JSON payload includes username and password.
Returns a JWT token upon successful authentication.

Secure endpoints based on roles:

Admin can access everything.

HR can access employee data.

Employees have limited access.

Example:

java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/admin-only")
public ResponseEntity<String> adminOnlyEndpoint() {
    return ResponseEntity.ok("This endpoint is accessible only by Admin.");
}
